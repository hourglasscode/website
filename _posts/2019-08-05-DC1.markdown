### Resources:
* :hammer_and_wrench:Hardware & Software:hash:
	* Checkout [Setup Your Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-31-setup-your-environment %})
	* GtkHash

### Process:
1. Download, verify hash, and setup @DCAU7's [DC: 1][DC: 1] Vulnerable OS 
	* The Network Adapter's default configuration is **Bridged**, I am going to change it to **Host-only** because I do not want it to communicate outsite of my Kali VM
		* [:gear:Advanced...]
			* Take note of the MAC Address
			```
			:::C4:CE:C1
			```

	* If utilizing VMware Workstation, select [Edit] from the toolbar
		* [Virtual Network Editor]
			* In my configuration, **host-only** is configured on **vmnet1** with the following:
```
Subnet IP: 172.16.169.0
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

2. Determine I.P. address of VM 
	* Open wireshark and select the **vmnet1** interface
	* Initialize the VM and you will be greated with a login screen:
```
Debian GBU/Linux 7 DC-1 tty1
DC-1 login:  
```
	* Wireshark will capture the ARP request and reply from the VM with the information we need
	Source | Destination | Protocol | Info
```
Vmware_c4:ce:c1 | Vmware_c0:00:01 | ARP | 172.16.169.129 is at :::c4:ce:c1
```

3. Port Scanning and Enumeration
	* Nmap TCP-connect scan of most common 20 TCP ports that are open
```console
# nmap -sT --top-port 20 172.16.169.129 -oG | grep open
	-sT : TCP connect port scan
	-top--ports : port scan the top 20 ports
22/tcp open ssh
80/tcp open http
111/tcp open rpcbind
```
	* Port 80 being open indicates that the DC1 may be hosting a web server
		* Opening a web browser and navigating to 172.16.169.129 presents us with a Drupal Site requesting a username and password
