I created this script in order to have a visual representation of previous scans from Nexpose.

In this example, I have a Google calendar with the following scan history.
</p>

<img src="/images/CalendarLog.png" width="430" alt="CalendarLog">

<p>
Before we proceed with the script we need to get the <strong>ID</strong> of the Calendar that we will be
updating.
  <ul>
    <li>Open your calendar</li>
    <li>Click on the small icon with the downward facing arrow</li>
    <li><img src="/images/calendar.png" width="430" alt="CalendarLog"></li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Calendar Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Scroll down and copy the <strong>Calendar ID</strong> into a temporary document.
        It should look something like this: "abcd123efg456@group.calendar.google.com"</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Go back to the Google Sheet</li>
    <li>The URL should looke something like this:
        ""docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/xyz10/edit#gid=1841025902"</li>
    <li>Copy and paste the <strong>xyz10</strong> portion respective to your sheet onto
        the aforementioned temporary document</li>
    <li>Also notate the name of the sheet containing the log</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on <strong>Tools</Strong></li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Script editor</strong> and paste the code below</li>
  </ul>

You will need to set the <strong>calendarID, spreadsheetID, and sheetName</strong> variables.

Once you execute the script, your calendar will be updated to reflect the scans and the scan names on
the sheet will be highlighted. The highlighting is there to ensure that as you add more scan events to
the log, those that have previously been added to the calendar are not duplicated.
